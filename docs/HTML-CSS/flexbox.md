## Flexbox basics

The basic idea is that you will create a flexbox container by using:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

Now, the elements inside of .container are children of the container.

The *display*, *flex-direction*, *flex-wrap*, and *flex-flow* properties impact the ordering and orientation of the flex container. 

The *justify-content*, *align-items*, and *align-content* properties can beapplied to the flex container to impact the alignment of the containerâ€™s children.
