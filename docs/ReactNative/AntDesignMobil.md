# Ant Design Mobile

Ant Design has a lot of components that can speed the creation of a React Native applciation, however, be aware, it is maintained in China and many of the defaults are in Chinese.  

The mobile project is not as well documented as the web counterpart, but with some tinkering you can find your way around.

## Installation

[Installation Docs](https://mobile.ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app)

The installation docs focus on using with Create-React-native-app.  However, if you are going to be ejected (because you are using Wix navigation, etc), you may want to first eject and then setup the babelrc file.
